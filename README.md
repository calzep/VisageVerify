# VisageVerify
 VisageVerify is a powerful image comparison tool that uses facial recognition technology to identify and match faces in photographs. It allows users to compare a set of reference images to a set of unknown images, and returns a percentage match for the best match found. It can be used for a variety of applications, such as identifying and removing duplicate images, or identifying and tracking individuals in security or surveillance applications. With its easy-to-use interface and high accuracy, VisageVerify is a valuable tool for anyone who needs to process and analyze large sets of images. 

 Additionally, VisageVerify can also be used to detect AI-generated images that do not accurately depict the subject intended to be in the image, making it an excellent tool for sifting through large amounts of images to find any potential inaccuracies or manipulations. With its advanced facial recognition technology, VisageVerify ensures that the images you work with are accurate and trustworthy.
